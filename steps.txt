  1. Initial Processing:
   - Get base price from sale_price or regular_price
   - Get weight from item if available, default to 1
   - Process both volume deals and digital coupons separately

  2. Volume Deals Price Calculation:
   - Match promo description against defined patterns
   - For quantity-based deals (e.g. "3 For $9.99"):
     * volume_deals_price = advertised total price
     * unit_price = volume_deals_price / quantity
   - For percentage discounts (e.g. "20% off"):
     * volume_deals_price = base_price - (base_price * discount_percentage)
     * unit_price = volume_deals_price
   - For dollar amount off (e.g. "$2 off"):
     * volume_deals_price = base_price - discount_amount
     * unit_price = volume_deals_price

  3. Digital Coupon Price Calculation:
   - Match coupon description against patterns
   - For fixed amount off:
     * digital_coupon_price = discount_amount
     * unit_price = (base_price - discount_amount)
   - For percentage off:
     * digital_coupon_price = base_price * (discount_percentage/100)
     * unit_price = base_price - digital_coupon_price
   - For quantity-based deals:
     * digital_coupon_price = discounted_total_price
     * unit_price = digital_coupon_price / quantity

  4. Price Validation Rules:
   - If unit_price equals base_price, clear unit_price
   - If volume_deals_price equals base_price, clear volume_deals_price
   - If digital_coupon_price equals base_price, clear digital_coupon_price
   - Round all calculated prices to 2 decimal places

  5. Order of Processing:
   - Initial processing is performed first
   - Volume deals are calculated second
   - Digital coupons are applied third
   - Price validation rules are applied last
